# Elemental-Crash

Elemental Clash is an exciting Minecraft mini-game that combines the classic capture-the-flag gameplay with elemental powers and abilities. In this game, players are divided into four teams, each representing one of the four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.

The objective of the game is to capture and hold control points scattered across the map. Each control point radiates the energy of a specific element, and teams must channel their elemental powers into these structures to capture them.

How to Play

01. Join the Server:
  First, you'll need to join the Minecraft server running the Elemental Clash plugin.
02. Assign Teams:
  Upon joining, you'll be automatically assigned to one of the four elemental teams: Fire, Water, Earth, or Air. Each team has a unique color and spawn location.
03. Elemental Weapons and Tools:
 Your team will provide you with a set of elemental weapons, tools, and armor. You can also craft additional elemental items using custom recipes specific to your element.
04. Capture Control Points:
  Locate the control points on the map and break the central structure to channel your team's elemental energy into it. However, be careful, as each element has strengths and weaknesses against the others:

   .Fire is strong against Air but weak against Water.

   .Water is strong against Fire but weak against Earth.

   .Earth is strong against Water but weak against Air.

   .Air is strong against Earth but weak against Fire.

   .Team Buffs: When your team captures a control point, all team members will receive a temporary regeneration buff, allowing them to recover health more quickly.

   .Friendly Fire: Friendly fire is disabled, so you can't accidentally harm your teammates.

   .Win Condition: The team that captures and holds the most control points by the end of the game wins!
